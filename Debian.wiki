Debian (/ˈdɛbiən/),[5][6] also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux
distribution composed of free and open-source software, developed by the
community-supported Debian Project, which was established by Ian Murdock on
August 16, 1993. The first version of Debian (0.01) was released on September
15, 1993,[7] and its first stable version (1.1) was released on June 17,
1996.[8] The Debian Stable branch is the most popular edition for personal
computers and servers. Debian is also the basis for many other distributions,
most notably Ubuntu.

Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel. The
project is coordinated over the Internet by a team of volunteers guided by the
Debian Project Leader and three foundational documents: the Debian Social
Contract, the Debian Constitution, and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. New
distributions are updated continually, and the next candidate is released after
a time-based freeze.

Since its founding, Debian has been developed openly and distributed freely
according to the principles of the GNU Project. Because of this, the Free
Software Foundation sponsored the project from November 1994 to November 1995.
When the sponsorship ended, the Debian Project formed the nonprofit
organization Software in the Public Interest to continue financially supporting
development.
