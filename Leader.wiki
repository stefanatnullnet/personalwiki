Vim's <leader> key is a way of creating a namespace for commands you want to
define. Vim already maps most keys and combinations of Ctrl + (some key), so
<leader>(some key) is where you (or plugins) can add custom behavior.

For example, if you find yourself frequently deleting exactly 3 words and 7
characters, you might find it convenient to map a command via nmap <leader>d
3dw7x so that pressing the leader key followed by d will delete 3 words and 7
characters. Because it uses the leader key as a prefix, you can be (relatively)
assured that you're not stomping on any pre-existing behavior.

The default key for <leader> is \, but you can use the command 

`:let mapleader =","` 

to remap it to another key (, in this case).
