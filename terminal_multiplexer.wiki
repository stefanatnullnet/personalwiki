A terminal multiplexer is a software application that can be used to multiplex
several separate pseudoterminal-based login sessions inside a single terminal
display, terminal emulator window, PC/workstation system console, or remote
login session, or to detach and reattach sessions from a terminal. It is useful
for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for
separating programs from the session of the Unix shell that started the
program, particularly so a remote process continues running even when the user
is disconnected.
