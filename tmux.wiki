tmux is an open-source [[terminal_multiplexer]] for Unix-like operating systems. 
It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single
window. It is useful for running more than one command-line program at the same
time. It can also be used to detach processes from their controlling terminals,
allowing remote sessions to remain active without being visible.

= tmux cheatsheet =

start new session:
`tmux`

Start new tmux session with spec. session name:
`tmux new -s session_name`

I use a special shell script to run the tmux sessions I work with most

To attach to an existing session
`tmux a -t session_name`

List all active sessions:
`tmux ls`

Kill session:
`tmux kill-session -t session_name`

Kill all the tmux sessions:
TODO: search a better way to kill all sessions
