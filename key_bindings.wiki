Key bindings are a way of using keys on your PC keyboard or any external
keyboard to control any of the parameters within your HiQnet London Architect
design file. A key binding is an association between a physical key on a
keyboard and a parameter. A parameter can have any number of key bindings
associated with it, and a particular key binding can control any number of
parameters.

Key bindings detects individual keys being pressed. It does not distinguish
between upper and lower case, and modifiers such as SHIFT or CTRL are seen as
separate key presses.

Key bindings will only function when HiQnet London Architect is running, is in
Operate mode, and is the foreground application.
